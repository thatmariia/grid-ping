.. py:class:: Connectivity(params_ping: src.params.ParamsPING.ParamsPING, coupling_weights: numpy.ndarray[(int, int), float])

   This class contains information about connectivity between neurons in the oscillatory network.

   The interaction strength of lateral connections is represented by a matrix :math:`K` of pairwise coupling weights
   defined by an exponential function decaying by the Euclidean distance between the PING networks they belong to:

   :math:`K_{v, w} = C_{ \mathsf{type}(v), \mathsf{type}(w)} \exp (-\| \mathsf{cmap}(v), \mathsf{cmap}(w) \| / s_{v, w}),`

   where

   * :math:`v, w` are two arbitrary neurons in the network,
   * :math:`\mathsf{type}(v)` maps a neuron to its type (see :obj:`NeuronTypes`),
   * :math:`\mathsf{cmap}(v)` maps a neuron to its grid_location in the visual cortex (see :obj:`StimulusLocations`),
   * :math:`s_{v, w}` is the spatial constant (see :obj:`ParamsConnectivity`).

   The coupling weights are a part of current (see :obj:`CurrentComponents`).
   This equation was introduced in :cite:p:`Izhikevich2003`. This class performs the assignment of neurons to relevant PING networks arranged in a grid and computes the matrix
   of coupling weights.

   :param params_ping: parameters describing PING networks and their composition.
   :type params_ping: ParamsPING

   :param coupling_weights: coupling weights between all pairs of neurons.
   :type coupling_weights: numpy.ndarray[(int, int), float]

   :ivar params_ping: parameters describing PING networks and their composition.
   :ivar coupling_weights: coupling weights between all pairs of neurons.
