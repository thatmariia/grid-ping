.. py:class:: PINGNetworkPixels(center: tuple[float, float], pixels: list[tuple[int, int]], atopix: float, grid_location: tuple[int, int])

   This class contains information about a single stimulus patch-related information about a PING network.

   :param center: coordinates of the center of the PING network within the stimulus patch.
   :type center: tuple[float, float]

   :param pixels: list of pixel coordinates that belong to the PING network.
   :type pixels: list[tuple[int, int]]

   :param atopix: conversion coefficient between pixels and visual degrees.
   :type atopix: float

   :param grid_location: index of the PING network in the grid.
   :type grid_location: tuple[int, int]


   :ivar center: coordinates of the center of the PING network within the stimulus patch (in pixels).
   :ivar pixels: list of coordinates that belong to the PING network (in pixels).
   :ivar center: coordinates of the center of the PING network within the stimulus patch (in degrees).
   :ivar pixels: list of pixel coordinates that belong to the PING network (in degrees).
   :ivar grid_location: index of the PING network in the grid.
