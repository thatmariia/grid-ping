.. py:class:: Connectivity(nr_neurons: dict[Any, int], neur_slice: dict[src.NeuronTypes.NeuronTypes, slice], nr_ping_networks: int, coupling_weights: numpy.ndarray[(int, int), float])

   This class contains information about connectivity between neurons in the oscillatory network.

   The interaction strength of lateral connections is represented by a matrix :math:`K` of pairwise coupling weights
   defined by an exponential function decaying by the Euclidean distance between the PING networks they belong to:

   :math:`K_{v, w} = C_{ \mathsf{type}(v), \mathsf{type}(w)} \exp (-\| \mathsf{cmap}(v), \mathsf{cmap}(w) \| / s_{v, w}),`

   where
   * :math:`v, w` are two arbitrary neurons in the network,
   * :math:`\mathsf{type}(v)` maps a neuron to its type (see :obj:`NeuronTypes`),
   * :math:`\mathsf{cmap}(v)` maps a neuron to its location in the visual cortex (see :obj:`StimulusLocations`),
   * :math:`s_{v, w}` is the spatial constant (see :obj:`constants.SPATIAL_CONST`).

   This equation was introduced in :cite:p:`Izhikevich2003`.

   This class performs the assignment of neurons to relevant PING networks arranged in a grid and computes the matrix
   of coupling weights.
