.. py:class:: PINGNetwork(location: tuple[int, int], excit_ids: list[int], inhibit_ids: list[int])

   Class containing locational information about a single PING network oscillator.

   :param location: coordinates of this oscillator within the grid.
   :type location: tuple[int, int]

   :param excit_ids: id's of excitatory neurons located in this oscillator.
   :type excit_ids: list[int]

   :param inhibit_ids: id's of inhibitory neurons located in this oscillator.
   :type inhibit_ids: list[int]

   :ivar location: coordinates of this oscillator within the grid.
   :type location: tuple[int, int]

   :ivar ids: A dictionary with id's of neurons of both types in this oscillator.
   :type ids: dict[NeuronTypes, list[int]]

   .. py:method:: __eq__(self, other)

      Return self==value.
