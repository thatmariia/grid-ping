.. py:class:: PINGNetworkNeurons(grid_location: tuple[int, int], excit_ids: list[int], inhibit_ids: list[int])

   Class containing neural locational information about a single PING network oscillator.

   :param grid_location: coordinates of this oscillator within the grid.
   :type grid_location: tuple[int, int]

   :param excit_ids: id's of excitatory neurons located in this oscillator.
   :type excit_ids: list[int]

   :param inhibit_ids: id's of inhibitory neurons located in this oscillator.
   :type inhibit_ids: list[int]


   :ivar grid_location: coordinates of this oscillator within the grid.
   :ivar ids: A dictionary with id's of neurons of both types in this oscillator.

   .. py:method:: __eq__(self, other)

      Return self==value.
