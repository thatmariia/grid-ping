.. py:class:: ParamsPING(nr_excitatory: int, nr_inhibitory: int, nr_ping_networks: int = 1)

   Bases: :py:obj:`src.params.Params.Params`

   This class contains parameters describing PING networks and their composition.

   :param nr_excitatory: number of excitatory neurons in the network.
   :type nr_excitatory: int

   :param nr_inhibitory: number of inhibitory neurons in the network.
   :type nr_inhibitory: int

   :param nr_ping_networks: number of PING networks in the network.
   :type nr_ping_networks: int

   :raises:
       AssertionError: if the number of excitatory neurons is smaller than 2.
   :raises:
       AssertionError: if the number of inhibitory neurons is smaller than 2.
   :raises:
       AssertionError: If the number of PING networks is smaller than 1.
   :raises:
       AssertionError: if number of excitatory neurons doesn't divide the number of PING networks as there should be
       an equal number of excitatory neurons in each PING network.
   :raises:
       AssertionError: if number of inhibitory neurons doesn't divide the number of PING networks as there should be
       an equal number of inhibitory neurons in each PING network.
   :raises:
       AssertionError: if the number of PING networks is not a square as PING networks should be arranged in a square
       grid.


   :ivar nr_neurons: dictionary of number of neurons of each type and the total number of neurons.
   :ivar neur_slice: indices of each type of neurons.
   :ivar nr_ping_networks: number of PING networks in the network.
   :ivar grid_size: number of PING networks in each row and column.
